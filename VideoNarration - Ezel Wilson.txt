When the game starts the user can choose what category the words will be in. Then the game prints the hangman display, a dash for each letter in the word, how many attempts the user has left, and the letters they guessed so far. Next it lets the user guess a letter. It does not let them guess the same letter twice or multiple letters at a time. After they guess it updates the display and will replace a dash if the letter is the same as the dash. The game round will end if they guess all the letters or run out of guesses. When it ends they can choose to play again if so then they can change category if they want.
