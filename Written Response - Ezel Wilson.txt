One difficulty in programming was the spacing when printing the hangman display, some of the body parts would be on different parts of the screen. This was solved by removing all the tabbing in the drawing and replacing them with spacing. Another difficulty in programming was that the program would recount the letters the user got correct and if the code ran long enough then it would say the user has guessed the word correct. This was solved by resetting the letters the user got correct at the beginning of the while loop. One development I did independently was programming the category function which allows the user to select the category the word will be from.
